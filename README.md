## Installation prerequisites
The Universal library depends on these libraries and python packages:

 - [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)
 - [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
 - [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

You can install them with the following bash commands:
```Bash
sudo apt-get -y install nlohmann-json3-dev # Required by the C++ library
pip install numpy matplotlib # Required by python tools
```
## Library installation
1. Clone the repository.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/scorp18pl/universal.git
    cd universal
    ```
2. Create and proceed to the build directory.
    ```bash
    mkdir build && cd build
    ```
3. Install the library.
    ```bash
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    sudo make install
    ```

## Using the library (CMake)
In your project's CMakeLists.txt file:
1. Find the library.
    ```CMake
    find_library(UNIVERSAL universal)
    ```
2. Link the found library with your target.
    ```CMake
    target_link_libraries(<target_name> ${UNIVERSAL})
    ```
